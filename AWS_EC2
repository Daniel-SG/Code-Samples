EC2 
 - Instance of a virtual machines in AWS
 - In the security groups you can define inbound and outbound traffic
 - Elastic IP allows to keep the same public IP even you you stop and start your EC2 instance
 - If you want to launch an script when starting the instance, you have to add it in the "Advanced Detais -> User Data" when configuring the instance
 	example of installing apache httpd and adding info in index.html:
 	#!/bin/bash
	# Use this for your user data (script without newlines)
	# install httpd (Linux 2 version)
	yum update -y
	yum install -y httpd.x86_64
	systemctl start httpd.service
	systemctl enable httpd.service
	echo "Hello World from $(hostname -f)" > /var/www/html/index.html

Types of EC2
	 On demand: Pay for what you use
	  - They are the most expesive
	  - Recommended for short terms and interrupted workloads

	Reserved instances
	 - from 1 to 3 years
	 - payment upfront
	 - 75% discount compared to On demand
	 - There are other subtypes like..
	 	- Convertible Reserved instance: Can change the EC2 instance type, up to 54% discount
	 	- Scheduled Reserved instance: Launch within the time window you reseve (1 hour a day, from 15 to 18 etc)

	Spot Instances
		- 90% discount
		- You can lose the instance at any time if your max price is less than the current spot price
		- Useful for jobs that can be rerun (batch process, image rendering...)
		- If your spot is claimed you can block it from 1 to 6 hours
		- If you cancel a spot request, the spot instance is not cancelled, you have to do it manually
		Spot Fleets
			- Define possible launch pools and launch the one that fits better according the strategy choosen (lowestPrice,diversified,capacityOptimized)

	Dedicated Host
		- Physical dedicated host for your use (not shared)
		- Full control for EC2 instance
		- 3 years contract
		- More expensive
		- Useful to bring your own licensed software

	Dedicated Instance
		- Instances running hardware that is dedicated to you
		- May share the hardware with other accounts but only your accounts
		- No control over instance placement

	There are as well other types of Instances:
		- R apps that need a lot of RAM
		- C apps that need good CPU (databases,computational things)
		- M Medium approach between Ram and CPU (general,Webs)
		- I Apps that need good I/O (databases)
		- G Apps that need good GPU (Video rendering, machine learning)

		T2/T3 bustable instances (up to capacity, use credits)
		T2/T3 unlimeted burst
